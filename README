uHome is:
	- a stand alone executable
	- looks for a configurable list of 1-N devices on a network
		- identified by IP address
	- if any one of those is found on the network, then it immediately exits 0
	- if none of those devices are found on the network, then it exits 1
	- can be run periodically via cron (default is every 5 minutes)
